# Finetuning Large Language Models

This repository contains code and resources for the "Finetuning Large Language Models" course. The course covers:

- **Distinctions between Finetuning and Other Methods**: Learn the differences between finetuning, prompt engineering, and retrieval augmented generation.
- **Integrating Finetuning into the Training Process**: How to effectively incorporate finetuning.
- **Instruction Finetuning**: Training LLMs to follow instructions, similar to ChatGPT.

## Using Lamini for Finetuning

This repository demonstrates how to use [Lamini](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/finetuning-large-language-models/) to finetune large language models with just 3 lines of code.

## Getting Started
